# Schelling's Model of Segregation Simulation

This repository contains a Java implementation of Thomas Schelling's Model of Segregation. This simulation visualizes how slight individual preferences can lead to significant societal segregation.

## Features

- Interactive GUI to visualize the simulation in real-time.
- Adjustable parameters for population size, satisfaction threshold, and more.
- Statistical analysis to measure the degree of segregation over time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Java SE Development Kit 8 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/schelling_simulation.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

- Launch the application.
- Adjust the simulation parameters as desired.
- Start the simulation and observe the results.

## Acknowledgments

- Thomas Schelling for the original model and theory.
